## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Iris Flower Dataset
#### Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It allows us to gain a basic understanding of the dataset by exploring its features, distributions, and relationships between variables. In this document, we will perform EDA on the Iris Flower Dataset, a simple dataset designed for learning and understanding fundamental data analysis techniques.

#### About the Iris Flower Dataset

The Iris Flower Dataset, created by Ronald Fisher in 1936, is a classic and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of measurements from three different species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The dataset includes four features for each flower:

    Sepal Length (in centimeters)
    Sepal Width (in centimeters)
    Petal Length (in centimeters)
    Petal Width (in centimeters)

The objective of this EDA is to classify a new flower into one of the three species based on these four features. It's important to note that we do not consider the flower's color as a feature in this analysis.

##### Getting Started

To follow along with this EDA, make sure you have the dataset file (usually in CSV format) ready. You can load the dataset into your Python environment using libraries like Pandas:

import pandas as pd

##### Load the Iris dataset

Dataset Overview
Number of Data Points and Features

The Iris dataset consists of 150 data points (rows) and 5 columns (features).

##### Check the shape of the dataset
print(iris.shape)  # Output: (150, 5)

python

import pandas as pd

##### Load the Iris dataset
iris = pd.read_csv('iris.csv')

Dataset Overview
Number of Data Points and Features

The Iris dataset consists of 150 data points (rows) and 5 columns (features).

python

##### Check the shape of the dataset
print(iris.shape)  # Output: (150, 5)

Column Names

The dataset contains the following columns:

    Sepal Length
    Sepal Width
    Petal Length
    Petal Width


##### Display the column names
print(iris.columns)

##### Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(iris.head())

#### Data Exploration
Distribution of Data Points

The dataset is balanced, with each species having 50 data points.
# Count of data points for each species
print(iris['species'].value_counts())

##### 2-D Scatter Plot

We can visualize the relationship between two features with a 2-D scatter plot. Here's an example using sepal length and sepal width:
iris.plot(x='sepal_length', y='sepal_width', kind='scatter', label='datapoints')
plt.show()

##### Pair Plots

Pair plots are useful for visualizing relationships between all possible pairs of features. In our case, we have four features, resulting in six pair plots.

sns.set_style("whitegrid")
sns.pairplot(iris, hue='species', size=3)
plt.show()

##### Visualizing the Covariance Matrix

The covariance matrix can help us understand how features are related. Here's a heatmap of the covariance matrix:

sns.set(style="white")
corr = iris.corr()
mask = np.zeros_like(corr, dtype=np.bool)
mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True
f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11, 9))
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(220, 10, as_cmap=True)
sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0, square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={"shrink": .5})
plt.show()


###Conclusion

Exploratory Data Analysis is a critical step in understanding your dataset before diving into more advanced analysis or modeling. In the case of the Iris Flower Dataset, we've explored its basic characteristics, visualized the data, and gained insights into the relationships between features. This foundational knowledge is essential for making informed decisions when working with data.
